        ' The wheat crop requires a well-pulverized but compact seed bed for good and uniform germination. Three or four ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy season, followed by three or four cultivations and planking immediately before sowing produce a good, firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils. 23 to 25 0 C mean daily temperature.It is desirable that 2 to 3 tonnes of farmyard manure per hectare or some other organic matter is applied 5 or 6 weeks before sowing.'

        'Lemons can be grown in all types of soils. Light soils having good drainage are suitable for its cultivation. PH range of soil should be 5.5-7.5. They can also grow in slightly alkaline and acidic soils.Land should be ploughed, cross ploughed and leveled properly. Planting is done on terraces against slopes in hilly areas. The Ideal temperature is 20°C - 25°C. High density planting is also possible in such areas.'

        'Grape cultivation is generally not done during monsoon. Grape plant begins to grow 10-15 days after planting. Grape growth starts earlier in warm season than in cold season. Just a month after planting, the plants require staking and training.Soils of vineyard are either heavy clay soils, or sandy loam soils. So, organic manure is of high importance. Apply 20 grams urea to just planted vines in March. Repeat in May and July. Early in the day when the temperature is below 20 degree Celsius.'

The soil should be free from hard substrata and water-logged conditions. Soils with heavy clay or compact subsoil are to be avoided.'

Heavy soils, if well drained, yield good crops but cultivation becomes difficult.The pH of soil should be 6.5 to 7.5 and EC of water should be less than 1.0. Plant is highly sensitive to water-logged soils. A dry climate with about 50-75 cm of rainfall from June-September and with well defined summer and winter season is ideal.Temperature 250 C is most ideal and extreme cold and high temperatures are determinate.'

It can be fitted in any type of farming system and can thrive well in high hills, foothills as well as mid-hills situations.The best time for peach planting is June to August. If there is no rain after transplanting, light irrigation is given.Peach is less affected by diseases and pests. However, sometimes, powdery mildew and shot hole cause damage to the crop. disease is controlled by spraying Sulfex @ 2.5g/l of water.'
